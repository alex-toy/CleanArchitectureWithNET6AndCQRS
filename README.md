# Clean Architecture With .NET 6 And CQRS

Most of the traditional architectures raise fundamental issues of tight coupling and separation of concerns. The Onion Architecture tries to solve those issues. Here are the main facts about Onion Architecture :
- it provides a better way to build applications in perspective of better testability, maintainability, and dependability. 
- it addresses the challenges faced with 3-tier and n-tier architectures, and to provide a solution for common problems. 
- it is based on the inversion of control principle. 
- it is comprised of multiple concentric layers interfacing each other towards the core that represents the domain. The architecture does not depend on the data layer as in classic multi-tier architectures, but on the actual domain models.
